# Getting Support

We're a small team dedicated to making Bigger Blacker Book the best tool for your sexual health journey. Here’s how you can get help, report issues, and share your ideas with us.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs
## ⭐ Preferred Method: In-App Reporting

If you've found a bug, the best way to let us know is by [**opening a bug report**](https://github.com/betterfraternization/BiggerBlackerBookSupport/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). The more detail you can provide, the faster we can fix it. Please include:
The fastest and most effective way to report a bug, request a feature, or suggest a translation fix is from inside the app:

- App version, your device (e.g., iPhone 15), and OS version (e.g., iOS 17.5).
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- What you expected to happen versus what actually happened.
1.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  Tap on **Support**.
3.  Select **Report an Issue** and choose the appropriate category.

**Please do not include screenshots or logs containing sensitive personal data.**
This method automatically includes helpful diagnostic information while protecting your privacy.

## 💡 Feature Requests
##  বিকল্প Method: Manual GitHub Issue

Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it! Please [**submit a feature request**](https://github.com/betterfraternization/BiggerBlackerBookSupport/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
